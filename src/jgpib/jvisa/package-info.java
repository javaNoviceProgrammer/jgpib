<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>
    There are two <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans 8</a> projects, 
    JVisa and JVisaOscilloscope, which compile into libraries in the 
    "dist" folder, JVisa.jar and JVisaOscilloscope.jar respectively. Use
    JVisaOscilloscope for VISA compliant oscilloscopes and JVisa for all
    other VISA compliant instruments. JNA libraries are archived in 
    "dist/lib/JnaVisa64_13.jar". Under Windows, you have to download a VISA DLL 
    into a classpath folder since I cannot distribute it here for 
    copyright reasons. I got mine from 
    <a href="http://www.tektronix.com">Tektronix</a>. Under Linux, you have to
    download and install libvisa.so.
